changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds penlights and stethoscopes to nurses and corpsmen, they can use them to reliably check if someone have specific types of organ damage and how much, without the need of other apparatus. Adds a new organ.status called \"LITTLE_BRUISED\", used by the stethoscope and penlight to not give false positives when diagnosticating someone (saying that they are healthy, when they actually have 9 heart damage)."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an outdated check that made the entire \"flash eyes with flashlight\" mechanic don't work at all. Also updated it to check some other things for ease of logic."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed typos on the abandoned \"flash eyes with flashlight\" code."
  - code_imp: "Added new functionalities for both the stethoscope and penlight: The stethoscopes can now be used to check the condition of both heart and lungs individually by aiming the chest, letting you be able to check if the organs are LITTLE_BRUISED (Have a damage equal or above 1), BRUISED (Have a damage equal or above 10), BROKEN (have a damage equal or above 30) or \"HEALTHY\" (any damage below 1). And the penlight, that can be used the same way to check the condition of brain and eyes by aiming the eyes of the person you are interacting with. Also with the fixing mentioned above, you can now flash people's eyes again! Everytime you check the condition of someone's eyes, you will also flash them. Replaced one letter vars in the flashlight code and on the stethoscope section of the ties code."
  - imageadd: "Adds new \"in_hand\" icons for penlights and stethoscopes, both will now appear on your hands when used. Penlights have both \"off\" and \"on\" icons, fancy stuff!"
